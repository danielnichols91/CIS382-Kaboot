The textbook describes the conditions for a relation schema to considered to be in third normal form as follows:
	A relation schema R is in the third normal form with respect to a set F of functional
	dependencies if, for all functional dependencies in F+ of the form α → β, where α ⊆ R
	and β ⊆ R, at least one of the following holds:
		• α → β is a trivial functional dependency.
		• α is a superkey for R.
		• Each attribute A in β−α is contained in a candidate key for R.

List of all functional dependencies within each table:
	Table: questions
		• question_id → prompt
	Table: answers
		• answer_id → answer_prompt, question_id, correct
	Table: room
		• room_code → question_duration, room_points
	Table: test_question
		• question_id → test_id
	Table: user_room
		• user_id → room_id
	Table: user_answers
		• question_id, test_id, user_id → answer_id

Demonstration that each table fits into third normal form:
	Table: questions
		• question_id → prompt
			The relation questions is in thrid normal form since the only functional 
			dependency is "question_id → prompt" which holds to the condition of "α 
			is a superkey for R" since question_id is a superkey for questions because
			it is defined as the primary key.  
	Table: answers
		• answer_id → answer_prompt, question_id, correct
			The relation answers is in thrid normal form since the only functional 
			dependency is "answer_id → answer_prompt, question_id, correct" which 
			holds to the condition of "α is a superkey for R" since answer_id is a 
			superkey for answers because it is defined as the primary key.    
	Table: room
		• room_code → question_duration, room_points
			The relation room is in thrid normal form since the only functional 
			dependency is "room_code → question_duration, room_points" which 
			holds to the condition of "α is a superkey for R" since answer_id is a 
			superkey for room because room_code is defined as the primary key. 
	Table: test_question
		• question_id → test_id
			The relation test_question is in thrid normal form since the only 
			functional dependency is "question_id → test_id" which holds to the 
			condition of "α is a superkey for R" since answer_id is a superkey for 
			test_question because question_id is defined as the primary key.
	Table: user_room
		• user_id → room_id
			The relation user_room is in thrid normal form since the only 
			functional dependency is "user_id → room_id" which holds to the 
			condition of "α is a superkey for R" since user_id is a superkey for 
			user_room because user_id is defined as the primary key.
	Table: user_answers
		• question_id, test_id, user_id → answer_id
			The relation user_answers is in thrid normal form since the only 
			functional dependency is "question_id, test_id, user_id → answer_id" 
			which holds to the condition of "α is a superkey for R" since (question_id, 
			test_id, user_id) is a superkey for user_answers because (question_id, 
			test_id, user_id) is defined as the primary key.
